          <h3>Karuna 2020</h3>
          <p>
            Karuna 2020 was an effort to try to bring together people and do our
            part in helping feed those most affected during the coronavirus
            pandemic. It was a collaboration between startups, corporates, and
            nonprofits in Delhi–NCR. During the COVID-19 lockdown, we helped
            feed 10,000+ people with a month's ration and distributed 100,000+
            masks to frontline workers.
