        <p>
          Karuna 2020 is an effort to try to bring together people and do our
          part in helping feed those most affected during the coronavirus
          pandemic. It's a collaboration between startups, corporates, and
          nonprofits in Delhi–NCR. During the COVID-19 lockdown, we helped feed
          10,000+ people and distributed 100,000+ masks to frontline workers.
